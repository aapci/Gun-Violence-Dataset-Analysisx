# Gun-Violence-Dataset-Analysisx
This project analyzes a dataset of gun violence incidents in the United States to gain insights into the prevalence and impact of gun violence
The goals of this project are to:

Identify patterns and trends in gun violence incidents by location, date, type of incident, and other factors.
Determine the relationship between the number of fatalities, injuries, and other factors in gun violence incidents.
Investigate the role of mental health issues, weapons, and other factors in gun violence incidents.
Create visualizations that effectively communicate the insights gained from analyzing the data.
# Data
The gun violence dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle.com], and includes information about the location, date, summary, fatalities, injuries, total victims, age of shooter, mental health status, weapons used, race, gender, and other factors related to gun violence incidents in the United States. The data was preprocessed to remove duplicate entries, fill in missing values, and convert data types as needed.

# Results
The analysis of the gun violence dataset yielded several key findings, including:

Most gun violence incidents occur in urban areas, with the highest number of incidents occurring in California, Texas, and Florida.
There is a strong positive correlation between the number of fatalities and the number of injuries in gun violence incidents.
Approximately 25% of gun violence incidents involve a shooter with prior signs of mental health issues.
Handguns are the most commonly used weapon in gun violence incidents.
These findings are visualized using several types of charts and graphs, including scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts, and tree maps.

# Conclusion
The analysis of the gun violence dataset highlights the serious and pervasive nature of gun violence in the United States, and underscores the need for policies and interventions to address this issue. By analyzing the patterns and trends in gun violence incidents, policymakers and researchers can better understand the causes and consequences of this phenomenon, and develop evidence-based solutions to prevent and reduce gun violence.
